HTTP vs HTTPS: a guide to web security

Introduction:
        In the broad internet environment, two acronyms, HTTP and HTTPS, play critical roles in molding our online 
        experiences. Understanding the differences between these protocols is critical for a newbie navigating 
        the world of websites and cybersecurity. In this introductory introduction, we'll look at what 
        HTTP and HTTPS are, why they're important, and how they affect your online security.

HTTP:
        HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. Imagine it 
        as the language spoken between your web browser and the server hosting a website. When you type a web address 
        into your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the web page to be displayed on your screen.

Key Points:
   * HTTP is plain text, meaning the data exchanged is not encrypted.
   * It's fast and efficient for basic data transfer.
   * Suitable for websites where security is not a top priority.

HTTPS:
        HTTPS, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, is the secure version of HTTP. The 'S' at the end stands 
        for 'Secure,' and it brings an extra layer of protection to your online interactions. In simple terms, HTTPS
        encrypts the data exchanged between your browser and the server, making it significantly harder for malicious 
        actors to intercept or tamper with the information.

Key Points:
   * HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols for encryption.
   * It ensures a secure and private connection between the user and the website.
   * Essential for websites handling sensitive information like login credentials, payment details, etc
